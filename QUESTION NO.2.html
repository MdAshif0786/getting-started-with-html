Comment is something that is useful for our futureself and for a better idea and
understanding afterwards if someone else codes in the same database. It won't be
executed on the screen ,means it will not run but if the coder wants to see the
program he/she will be able to understand the code in a better way by reading
comments,and the comments are not going to render as well. Syntax:-
<!--Add your comments here -->
Example
<!--Ashif is a good boy-->
#It will not be executed on the screen but it will be there in the program.
